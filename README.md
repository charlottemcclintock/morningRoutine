# morning routine

### original idea:

I want an app that does the following: when I first open my computer in the morning, it says "Hello Charlotte", and gives me some core facts about the day (weather, sunrise, sunset, my calendar) and offers me some options for how to start my day - brown noise on spotify, recipes for breakfast, idea for a walk.

side benefit: an excuse to learn fundamentals of app development.
